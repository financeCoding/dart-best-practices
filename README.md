* Format for each best practice is loose and will evolve organically.
    * File name should be `XXXXXX - Description.md`, where XXXXXX is 6 digits, unique and incrementing.
        * _Why not try for a million?_
    * Markdown formatting
    * Title on top
    * Include author information? Examples? Suggestions? Links to more info? Category info?
* Send pull requests if you have more

## Long-term goal

* Get this on a dedicated web site backed by a database.
* Build a tool (in Dart) that can run against an existing code base.
* Where possible, allow practices to define "find" methods to find instances of violated practices
* Where possible, allow practices to "fix" code, with user authorization.
